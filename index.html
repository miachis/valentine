            February 13th 2020, You said yes to me and it has been a wonderful
            journey for both of us. I want this day to be all about us
            reminiscing about all the times we have stared at each other in
            class without saying a word and all the times we were trying our
            best not to get caught by those wicked teachers in cedar.

            6 years ago, we were young lovers, we didn't really know what we
            were doing but somehow we kept on doing it and it was fun. We have
            had alot of arguements and alot of wonderful experiences together.
            We have literally argued about the most dumbest reasons 😭 but
            somehow it built us to become how who are today, real lovers.

            I just want you to feel very special on this day and I want you to
            know how amazing you are and how happy I am the very first day I set
            my eyes on you in Cedar College. Chai crazy times fr 😂. I thank you
            for giving me this chance to be by your side and love you in every
            way possible. Thank you for sticking with me for 6 good years and I
            hope we get to be together for eternity.
