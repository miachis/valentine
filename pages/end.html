          Thank you for being such a wonderful person to me Ekomhen Confidence,
          I really appreciate all that you've done for me, those I know of and
          those I don't even know of. I love you for making me a better person
          and I promise to love you exactly how you want to be loved. I promise
          to get you beautiful flowers some day, take you on an expensive date
          and put a ring on your finger. I promise to put you first as always. I
          want to be the reason behind your smile and your comfort when you're
          uncomfortable. I love how you smell, how beautiful and pretty you
          always look, how nice you are to others, how sexy you are, how hard
          working you are. You have really met all the criterias to become my
          wife and I seriously can't wait to get married and we finally do what
          we have planned if you know what I mean. Thank you for being the best
          girlfriend & wife I could ever ask God for. Baby notice how the
          background is your favorite color too, intentional man wan kill me.
          Cheers to 6 years and many more years to come. I love you boo-boo.
